This project involves the analysis and visualization of sales data for a Organisation using Power BI. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the year-to-date (YTD) sales performance, compare it against the previous year's data (PYTD), and identify key metrics that impact profitability and sales growth. The insights provided help in making data-driven decisions for better sales and profitability management.

Project Overview
The dashboard visualizes sales data across different metrics, allowing stakeholders to:

Monitor YTD sales performance against PYTD.
Analyze gross profit percentage (GP%) and its impact on sales.
Track monthly sales trends and identify underperforming regions.
Segment profitability based on account performance.
Data Overview
The dataset includes detailed sales data with the following columns:

Country: The country where sales were recorded.
Product_Type: The type of product sold (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor).
Date Month: The month when the sales were recorded.
Sales (USD): The sales amount in US dollars.
Quantity Sold: The total number of units sold.
Gross Profit (GP%): The percentage of gross profit made from sales.
Key Features of the Dashboard
YTD vs PYTD Analysis:

Displays the difference between current year sales (YTD) and the previous year sales (PYTD).
Highlights monthly sales performance, indicating growth or decline in sales with color-coded bars (green for increase, red for decrease).
Top 10 and Bottom 10 Country Performance:

A treemap visualization shows the bottom 10 countries based on YTD vs PYTD sales differences, helping to identify regions with declining sales.
Monthly Sales and Product Type Analysis:

A clustered column and line chart showcases sales trends by month and product type.
Tracks the YTD and PYTD sales values for different product categories (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor).
Profitability Segmentation:

A scatter plot segmentation visual represents account profitability based on GP% and sales value.
Helps to identify high-performing accounts and potential outliers.
Key Metrics:

Gross Profit: Total profit generated from sales, displayed as a KPI metric.
Sales Quantity: Total units sold.
GP%: Gross profit percentage, indicating profitability.
Insights and Observations
Sales Decline: March shows a significant decline in sales compared to PYTD, with a YTD vs PYTD difference of -154,219.90 USD.
Underperforming Regions: Countries like Canada, Colombia, and Croatia are among the bottom performers, showing a substantial drop in YTD sales compared to PYTD.
Product Trends: Indoor products had a consistent sales trend, while Outdoor products showed a decline in sales by April.
Profitability Analysis: The scatter plot reveals segments with high GP% and low sales volume, indicating niche products or premium services.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Excel: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed for calculating YTD and PYTD measures, KPIs, and custom metrics.
